# ReactiveX Tutorial

## Overview

This is a very brief intro into Rx.Net / ReactiveX aka Reactive Extensions.

This repo was prepared and used for an internal training with fellow developers.

The repo contains an Agenda.PPTX with a quick agenda (obviously) and a C# Console program to demonstrate some concepts.

The lessons are in the Lessons folder and are run by the LessonExecutor which is not part of the training but for what its worth was also implemented as an observable.

Each Lesson has its own class file with a quick comment about what is demonstrated in the lesson.
